- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aadityakiran-S
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that has anything to do with computers but as of 10-5-2022, I'm just starting out, I won't have much to put up at this time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms. Just thought I'd get the basics down before going on to make something. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything basically.... don't have any prejudices. 
- 📫 How to reach me: aadityakirans@gmail.com
